#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer

     Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools to develop high quality software system
     Its important in technology  as it creates software applications and systems that improves modern life aspects like entertainment, Healthcare, agriculture and communications

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer

   The first milestone is the development of programming languages such as FOTRAN and C
   The second milestones was the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in different institutions
   The third and fourth milestones was the introduction of the structured programming in the 1970s and the emergence of agile technologies in the early 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer

   First is requirements - Here you gather the information on the user needs on the and the system requirements and documenting them
   Secondly is  design - which involves creating a high level detailed design architecture and the user interface
   Third is the Implementation cycle - where  you write code and build software according to the design specifications
   The fourth is testing cycle - where you carry out different tests  to get the assurance whether the software meets the quality standards and the functional requirements
   The fith cycle is  deployment cycle - here you now release the software for use by the customers or the intended users
   The final cycle is the maintenance cycle -  where you provide ongoing updates and support to enhance the software effectiveness after the deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer

   The waterfall approach - just like a waterfall it involves the first three cycles of software development - Requirements, Design, Implementation- taking some kind of linear approach
   The water fall approach unlike agile is not flexible and is unpredictable
   The waterfall approach is useful in scenarios where there need for a completely new software development
   The agile approach unlike the water fall adopts an incremental approach making it flexible adaptable to change and collaborative. It can be used in scenarios where the engineer is 
maintaining the software after deployment

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answer

   Software develop - writes codes and develop software solutions

   Quality assurance Engineer -  designs and execute test plans to ensure the quality for the software meet the standard and quality requirements

   Project Manager - Oversee planning,e xecution and delivery of projects in software

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer

   IDEs - They provide comprehensive tools for writing and debugging example of such software suites are visual studio and exclipse

   VCS - are used to track the source code changes and improves coordination and collaboration between team members examples of VCS is the Git and Subversions

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Answer 

   First is the changing of the requirements that may come in the middle of the project cycle cousing scope screep and delays in the project timelines

   Second is Tight deadlines - The pressure to deliver the project according project schedule can sometimes compromise quality

   Third is the technical debt which emanates from using sub optimal solutions and shortcuts can increase maintenance costs and impede future development efforts

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Answer

   Unit Testing - Is the testing of individual software components or modules

   Intergration testing -  is the testing of interaction between different components of a software and subsystems

   System Testing - is the testing of the entire software system

   Acceptance testing - used to test the software to see if it meets the user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer

   Prompt engineering - is the carefull and clear crafting of statements and questions to get the best of answers from the AI models. It requires clarity, conciseness, complete and correct statements

   Prompt engineering is used in creation of chatbots, virtual assistance and content generations

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer

   Example of a vague prompt is "How to cook"
   If i improve this question, with more clarity i would ask "Recipe for cooking fried fish"
